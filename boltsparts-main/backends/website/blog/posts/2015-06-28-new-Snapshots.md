I put new development snapshots [online]({{ url(main.downloads) }}) for both
OpenSCAD and FreeCAD. There is not much new functionality, but a few bugfixes
that were contributed.
<!-- more -->

Main improvements:

* some fixes for using BOLTS for FreeCAD on Arch Linux (contributed by Jon Nordby)
* a fix that caused bearings come out too thick in FreeCAD (contributed by kkoksvik)

There was also a small but steady influx of suggestions for French translations
in [weblate](https://weblate.stbuehler.de/projects/BOLTS/), that I have
continuously  integrated. The translations are not yet used for the FreeCAD and
OpenSCAD backends, but only show up on the website.
