I wish everybody a happy new year 2015. I hope it will be a good year for BOLTS, I have a lot of ideas and hope to find a bit of time to work on it.

<!-- more -->

As a followup to last post, the lightning talk at [31C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Main_Page) went well (apart from the previous speaker hiding the clicker to advance the slides). There was a big peak in website traffic during and after the talk, so I hope a few people learned about BOLTS in this way.

As someone asked me about more languages for [translations](https://weblate.stbuehler.de/projects/BOLTS/), I tried to add swedish and noticed that I had forgotten how to do this. After I reconstructed that knowledge, I added a script that does that for me, so adding more languages is now easy. So if you want to help with translating BOLTS to another language, drop a comment.

As a bit of an outlook, I took on a redesign of the parameter handling code of BOLTS, and I believe I have figured out a very nice design that is much more powerful and flexible than the current code (which is in hindsight actually not so good). The new design will allow for an elegant solution to many new and old features.
