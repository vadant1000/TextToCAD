In the last few revisions there was a
[bug](http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/view.php?id=1816) in FreeCAD that
prevented BOLTS from working properly. It was fixed very quickly, so for those
of you that use daily builds of FreeCAD, tomorrow everything should work again.
Everyone else was not affected.
