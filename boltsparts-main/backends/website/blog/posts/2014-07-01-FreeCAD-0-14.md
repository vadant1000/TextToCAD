Just a quick note: [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org/), one of the CAD systems
that are supported by BOLTS at the moment, recently released version 0.14. This
version contains a huge number of new features, improvements and bug fixes. For
details see the
[Release Notes](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Release_notes_0.14).

And although it has been rather quiet on this blog for quite some time, I am
still working behind the scenes on a major rewrite of large portions of BOLTS,
which will allow a lot of improvements. Stay tuned.
