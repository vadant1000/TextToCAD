  title: Python 2.6 compatibility

With the help of FreeCAD user KeithSloan I was able to track down all
instances of [python 2.7 specific](https://github.com/jreinhardt/BOLTS/issues/60)
syntax and standard libraries, so that the current development snapshot of
BOLTS for FreeCAD is usable with python 2.6.

<!-- more -->

Problems were caused by dict comprehensions

    a = { k:[] for k in range(10) }

that were only introduced in python 2.7. A 2.6 compatible reformulation of this is

    a = dict((k,[]) for k in range(10))

Additionally the importlib was introduced to the standard library only in
python 2.7, but there exists a
[backport](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/importlib/1.0.2) for older versions.

The last problem was related to `check_output` from the `subprocess` module, which is not present in the python 2.6 standard library.

This allows users with python 2.6 (which is still used a lot e.g. in Ubuntu LTS
releases) to [use BOLTS]({{ doc_version(0.3, freecad,usage) }}) for FreeCAD. However for
development, the scripts that generate the distributions and the [utility
script]({{ doc_version(0.3, general,utility-script) }}) use 2.7 features and
it would be a lot of work to make these 2.6 compatible, so I do not plan to do
that.

Instead it might be a good idea to look into python 3 compatibility in the long
term.
