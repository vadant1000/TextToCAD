I will be giving a [lightning
talk](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Static:Lightning_Talks) about
BOLTS at the [31st Chaos Communication
Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Main_Page) in Hamburg in one
and a half weeks. It will be 5 minutes long and the talks will be live streamed
and recorded.

If you are also there and interested in meeting up and discussing, just drop me
a note.
