  title: How to create a base module
  audience: contributors
---

This tutorial shows you the preferred way to make a class from a
[collection]({{ doc(general,blt-files) }}) available in OpenSCAD.

This assumes that you have already a module available that takes a number of
parameters as input and builds the part that the class describes.

If not you have two options. Either you learn
[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html) and write such a module
yourself.

Or you try to find out if someone else has done this already. There are a number of sites where a lot of scad code is published:

 - [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/)
 - [Youmagine](https://www.youmagine.com/)
 - [Cubehero](https://cubehero.com/)
 - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
 - [Bld3r](http://www.bld3r.com/)
 - [list with many more](http://reprap.org/wiki/Printable_part_sources)

However, to use code written by someone else, you need to make sure that there
are no licensing problems. I wrote about licensing in BOLTS
[here]({{ doc(general,licensing) }}). If the code has no licensing
information or is published under a incompatible license, you can try to
contact the author and ask him to dual-license with a license that allows
inclusion in BOLTS.

This tutorial will illustrate the process using the example of the pipe
collection with a pipe module that lives in a file called `pipe.scad`:

     */

    module pipe(id,od,l){
        difference(){
            cylinder(r=od/2,h=l,center=true);
            cylinder(r=id/2,h=l+1,center=true);
        }
    }


### Putting the scad file to the right place

The file with the module should be moved to a subdirectory of the openscad
directory which is named after the collection id to which the part belongs. If
this directory does not exist, create it.

So in the case of the pipes collection `pipe.scad` is now in the directory
`openscad/pipes` relative to the BOLTS root folder.

### Write the base file

This collection directory must also contain the base file for this directory.
The base file provides BOLTS with all the information it needs to know about
the files in a collection directory, it is a kind of manifest file. It
contains a list of sections 
(more precisely [base file elements]({{ spec(base-file-element) }})),
each describing one file.

For the pipes collection the base file is `openscad/pipes/pipes.base` and has
the following content:

    ---
    - filename: pipe.scad
      type: module
      author: Johannes Reinhardt <jreinhardt@ist-dein-freund.de>
      license: LGPL 2.1+ <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1>
      modules:
        - name: pipe
          arguments: [id, od, l]
          classids: [genericpipe, din11850range2]
      source: own work
    ...

The type field indicates, that this file contains one or more OpenSCAD
modules. The author field gives the author of `pipe.scad` and contact
information. In the license field the license of pipe.scad is indicated and
then follows the list of modules that are contained in the file.

In the case of `pipe.scad` there is only one module called `pipe`. The
arguments field gives the parameters that need to be supplied to the module.
The parameters must be a subset of the parameters of the class as it is
defined in the [blt file]({{ doc(general,blt-files) }}).

The `classids` field contains a list of classids which this module can
represent. Be careful, that the parameter names and meanings for all classes
in this list must be the same, otherwise the some parameters can not be found
for some classes.

There is the possibility to add an optional `source` field which allows to give
information about the origin of the file. If there is a URL from which this
file was downloaded, this can be included here.

### Testing

Now it should be tested that the newly added part really works. This is most
conveniently done using the 
[utility script]({{ doc(general,utility-script) }}):

    ./bolts.py export openscad
    ./bolts.py test openscad

This will fire up a OpenSCAD instance with the module search path set
appropriately, so that typing

    include <BOLTS.scad>

    DIN11850_Range_2("10",1000);

should give you a pipe with nominal diameter 10 and 1m length.

### Adding connectors

[Connectors]({{ doc(openscad,usage) }})
simplify the positioning of parts in OpenSCAD, but require a bit of
preparation. Three things need to be added: A function for the connectors
and a entry in the base file and drawings for the documentation.

The function is added to the `.scad` file, and calculates the position and
orientation for the various connector locations from the parameters of the
model. It returns a list containing as first element the origin of the
coordinate system in terms of global coordinates, as second element a list with
two directions for the first and second direction of the connector. In case the
direction is unknown, the function should return "Error".

For the pipes ths function could look like this:

    function pipeConn(l,location) =
    	(location == "front-in")  ? [[0,0,-l/2],[[0,0,1],[1,0,0]]] :
    	(location == "front-out") ? [[0,0,-l/2],[[0,0,-1],[-1,0,0]]] :
    	(location == "back-in")   ? [[0,0,+l/2],[[0,0,-1],[-1,0,0]]] :
    	(location == "back-out")  ? [[0,0,+l/2],[[0,0,1],[1,0,0]]] :
    	"Error";

Here only the origin of the connector depends on the length of the pipe, but
for other locations other parameters might be required. The function can make
use of all parameters that are available to the geometry modules in addition to
the location, and the order in which these are passed to the function is not
relevant.

To tell BOLTS about this and things like the available selection of locations
available. This is done by a additional field in the base file. The entries are
selfexplanatory, so here is the content of the base file with the connector
infos:

    ---
    - filename: pipe.scad
      type: module
      author: Johannes Reinhardt <jreinhardt@ist-dein-freund.de>
      license: LGPL 2.1+ <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1>
      modules:
        - name: pipe
          arguments: [id, od, l]
          classids: [genericpipe, din11850range2]
          connectors:
            name: pipeConn
            arguments: [l,location]
            locations: [front-in, front-out, back-in, back-out]
      source: own work
    ...

This is a good time to test again. You can use the utility script like shown
[earlier]({{ doc(openscad,basemodule) }}). Make sure all
connectors are where they should be and that this remains the case when you use
a range of parameters.

The final thing to do is create drawings for the connectors to visually show
their location for easy reference. The utility script can do most of the heavy
lifting, by creating OpenSCAD scripts for each location that shows the part
together with the connector there. 

    ./bolts.py connectors

This results in a directory called `connectordrawings` in the output directory.
It contains BOLTS for OpenSCAD and a directory called scad that contains scad
files for all classes with connectors that have no drawings.  All that remains
to do is to load these scripts into OpenSCAD, find a good angle and export a
png using `Design->export as image...`. Make sure that it is easy to understand
from the picture where the connector is located on the part, and how it is
oriented.The images go into the `pipes` subdirectory of the `drawings` folder.

[<img alt="Finding a good angle" src="{{ static(openscad-connectordrawings.png) }}" />]({{ static(openscad-connectordrawings.png) }})

The final step is to add entries to the base file in this folder to tell BOLTS
about all the drawings. Here is an example how it looks for the `front-in`
connector:

    - filename: pipe-back-in
      author: Johannes Reinhardt <jreinhardt@ist-dein-freund.de>
      license: CC0 1.0 <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>
      type: drawing-connector
      location: back-in
      source: own work
      classids: [genericpipe,din11850range2]

You should add your name as author. The license should be chosen to CC0, as
this makes things easier. `type` must be `drawing-connector`.

To check that everything went fine, you can use

    ./bolts.py tasks

and make sure that the classes you have been working on are not listed anymore
with `Missing Connectors` and `Missing Drawings`.


### Next steps

You might want to [contribute]({{ doc(general,development) }}) this
part to BOLTS, so that every user can profit from your efforts.
