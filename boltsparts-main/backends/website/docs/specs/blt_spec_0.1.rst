BLT Format 0.1
##############

A BOLT library consists of a directory containing a number of mandatory and optional subdirectories. The mandatory ones are

-blt: Contains the metadata files for the collections
-drawings: Contains the svg files for the individual parts

In addition to them, there may be present a number of directories each containing files necessary for one backend. The following directories are supported:

-scad: Contains the OpenSCAD base files.

blt
===

A blt file is a yaml file with a single document containing one associative array with the following keys:

-collection: mandatory. The Collection Header.
-scad: optional. The OpenSCAD Header.
-parts: mandatory. A list of Parts.

These structures are specified below.

Collection Header
-----------------

The collection header is an associative array that contains general information regarding the Collection. It contains the following keys:

- name: optional. A name for the collection.

- license: mandatory. A short form of the license of this file and a URL with more information
- blt-version: mandatory. The version of the blt format this collection follows.

OpenSCAD Header

The OpenSCAD header is an associative array that contains information regarding the output of this collection via the OpenSCAD backend. Required if the OpenSCAD backend is used. It contains the following keys:

- base-file: mandatory. The name of the file containing the OpenSCAD base modules. If these are distributed over more than one file, a list of filenames may also be given. All these files must be present in the scad folder.
- base-functions: mandatory. An associate array. The keys are the names of the base module names, the values are the names of the parameters of the base module.
