BOLTS Specification Version 0.3
###############################

The BOLTS library consists of several different components, processes and
conventions and a number of precisely defined concepts. The purpose of this
document is to specify them.

*****************************************
Parts, Classes, Standards and Collections
*****************************************


In this section some concepts are defined, that will be used later in the
specification of the blt-file_.

.. _part:

Parts
=====

A BOLTS repository_ contains a various sorts of data about objects, that are in
some way useful in CAD. A part is a object that can be described by a set of
dimensions. E.g. a piece of paper is described by its width of 210mm and its
height of 297mm.

.. _class:

Classes
=======

However, one often encounters parts that are very similar to each other, for
example just differing in their dimensions. These parts can then be more
efficiently described as a class of parts. To continue with the paper example,
a class describing pieces class could also contain a part with width 100mm and
height 100mm.

In a blt-file_ classes of parts are described, because this case is so frequent.
Some parts are one of a kind, so it is not uncommon to have classes that
contain just a single part.

The classes of technical parts that BOLTS deals with are often specified by
standards issued by standardization bodies. This can be specified for a class
in the blt-file_.

.. _collection:

Collections
===========

It turns out to be convenient to organize the classes of a bolts repository in
collections. A collection usually has one or few authors, the parts contained
are in some sense related to each other and all the data of a collection is
under the same licence.

Each collection has a one word identifier, the collection id. The collection id
is the filename (without extension) of the blt-file_ with the information about
the collection, and also explicitly specified in the blt-file_. For more
details information see there.

.. _repository:

**************
The repository
**************

A BOLTS repository is directory structure with a certain layout. It contains
all the data and metadata. The root directory contains at least a "data"
directory with the backend independent data in blt-file_, plus optionally a
number of database directories with data that can be used by a backend_. See
list-of-databases_ for details.

The data directory
==================

The data directory contains a number of blt-file_, one for each collection_.
These files contain the backend independent information about the parts in the
repository.

.. _database:

The databases
=============

A database directory is a directory that contains data about certain aspects of
the parts or data in a specific form.Backends can access this data to
transform the parts data into specific forms or collect information.

In contrast to the data in the blt-file_, the data in the database directories
is optional. If for a class_ this data is not available, the backend_ has to be
able to deal with it in an appropriate manner, for example by not processing
this class.


**************************************
Backends, Processing and Distributions
**************************************

In BOLTS the backend independent data and metadata is separated from the
backend specific data. The former is held in blt-file_, the latter in
database_ directories.

.. _backend:

Backend
=======

.. _distribution:

A backend is a process that uses backend independent data and data from
database_, transforms this data and outputs a set of files. This output is called
the distribution.

.. image:: processing.png
   :width: 100%


Am example for a backend would be a process that uses the backend independent data
about parts, their geometries and dimensions together with a number of
templates and stylesheets and produces a set of HTML pages with a nicely
rendered, browsable description of the parts. Other backends could produce data
that is suitable for use in specific CAD applications.

Backends are not specified in detail by this specification.

.. _blt-file:

Backend independent data - the blt file
=======================================

The backend independent data is stored in `yaml <http://yaml.org/>`_ files with
the extension .blt. These files contain exactly one YAML document consisting of
an associative array with the following keys:

- id: mandatory, string. The id of the collection. Must be identical to the
  filename of the blt file without the extension.
- name: optional, string. A name for the collection.
- description: optional, string. A description of the contents of this
  collection.
- author: mandatory, string or list of strings. The author of this collection
  with e-mail in <>. If multiple authors contributed significantly to this collection
  a list of authors may be given.
- license: mandatory, string. The name of the license for this collection and a
  URL pointing to the full text of the license enclosed in <>. Must be one of
  the supported-licenses_.
- blt-version: mandatory, number. The version of the blt format this collection
  follows.
- classes: mandatory. An list of class-element_.

The filename without the .blt extension is called the collection id. For
consistency they are repeated in the id field. Collection ids are one word
identifiers, which must be unique within the repository.  They should contain
only letters, numbers and underscores, and should be descriptive, as they may
be visible to the user. Some names can not be collection ids: common, gui,
template

.. _class-element:

Class element
-------------

A class element is an associative array that holds information about a
class_. It has the following keys:

- id: mandatory, string. The id of the class. Class ids are one word
  identifiers, which must be unique within the repository. This class id is
  used as a way to refer to the class, when the standard field is not set.
  They should contain only letters, numbers and underscores, and should be
  descriptive, as they may be visible to the user.
- naming: mandatory, naming-element_. A naming convention for the parts of this
  class.
- description: optional, string. A short description of the class.
- standard: optional, string or list of strings. The name of the standard, if
  class is standardized. In the case of multiple standards with identical
  specifications, a list of names can be given.
- status: optional, string. This can be used to indicate the status of the
  standard.  Possible values are "active" and "withdrawn", if absent, "active"
  is assumed.
- replaces: optional, string or list of strings. Standards that are superseded
  by this standard.
- parameters: optional, parameter-element_: Parameters for this class.
- url: optional, string or list of strings. A url with relevant information
  regarding the parts of this class. For example a link to a vendor, or to the
  specifying standard.  In the case of several identical standards, a list of
  urls has to be given.
- notes: optional, string. Notes for this class. Can be used to keep questions
  or additional information.
- source: mandatory, string. A short description where the information for this
  class originate. Should contain a URL if possible.

.. _parameter-element:

Parameter element
-----------------

A parameter element is an associative array that holds information about the
parameters of a part. This information is used when doing
parameter-collection_. Parameters are often dimensions, but are not
restricted to be. The following keys are contained in a parameter element.

- literal: optional, associative array. This array has as its key the parameter
  names of the literal parameters, as values the corresponding values. Literal
  parameters are rarely used.
- free: optional, list. This list contains the names of the parameters for
  which the user will provide this value.
- tables: optional, table-element_ or list of table-elements. This array
  contains tabular data. Usually the table index will be a free variable, for
  details see table-element_ and parameter-collection_.
- tables2d: optional, table2d-element_ or list of table2d-elements. This array
  contains tabular data. Usually row and column indices will be free variables,
  for details see table2d-element_ and parameter-collection_.
- types: mandatory, associative array. Contains as keys parameter names, as
  values their respective types. Possible types are: "Length (mm)", Length
  (in)", "Number", "Bool", "Table Index", "String", "Angle (deg)".
- defaults: optional, associative array. This array contains a default value
  for every free parameter. If absent, the default value defaults to the type
  specific values given in the table below.
- description: optional, associative array. This array contains short a short
  text for each parameter clarifying the meaning of the parameter in plain
  language.
- common: optional, list of lists of (lists or strings). This field contains a
  list of tuples that contain valaues for all free parameters in the order in
  which they are given in the free field. These tuples are  represented by a
  YAML list and contain common combinations of parameters. For more compact
  notation, every element of the tuple actually is a list of values, so the
  tuple represents all possible combinations of values for the parameters. A
  tuple element can also be ":" if the free variable is discrete (see table
  below), the being a shorthand for all possible values. Defaults to the empty
  list, if at least one free variable is not discrete. If all free variables
  are discrete, the default is the tuple with all possible parameter
  combinations.

============  ==============  =========
Type          Default Value   Discrete
============  ==============  =========
Length (mm)   10              no
Length (in)   1               no
Number        1               no
Bool          False           yes
Table Index   ""              yes
String        ""              no
Angle (deg)   0               no
============  ==============  =========

Some parameter names are forbidden: standard, name.

The two values of the type Bool are true and false (lowercase).

.. Limits on parameters could go here

.. _table-element:

Table element
-------------

Tables of data are very common in standards and very useful for specifying a
class_ of parts. A table element describes a table of values, where the row is
specified by the value an index parameter, and each column contains the value
for a parameter. A table element is an associative array that has the following
keys:

- index: mandatory, string: name of the index parameter. Has to specified to be
  of type "Table Index" in the parameter-element_.
- columns: mandatory, list of strings: list of parameter names corresponding to the
  columns of the table.
- data: mandatory, associative array: The keys are possible values of the index
  parameter, the values a list of values compatible with the types of the
  parameters specified in columns.

.. _table2d-element:

Table2D element
---------------

In some cases, a table-element_ is not powerful enough to represent the
relationship between the values of free parameters and other parameters, for
example if the value of a parameter depends on two free parameters at once.
This case is covered by a table2d-element.

A table2d-element allows to lookup the value of the result parameter for a row
given by a rowindex and a column given by a colindex.

A table2d-element_ is an associative array with the following keys:

- rowindex: mandatory, string: name of the parameter that is used to select a
  row. Has to be specified to be of type "Table Index" in the
  parameter-element_.
- colindex: mandatory, string: name of the parameter that is used to select a
  column. Has to be specified to be of type "Table Index" in the
  parameter-element_.
- columns: mandatory, list of strings. The possible values for the colindex.
- result: mandatory, string. The name of the parameter whose value is
  determined with this table.
- data: mandatory, associative array: The keys are possible values of the
  rowindex parameter, the values a list of values for the columns from which
  one is selected by the colindex.


.. _naming-element:


Naming element
--------------

The name of a part should be precise enough to completely describe it, and
therefore depends on the values of (some of) the parameters. A naming element is
an associative array that holds information about the name of the parts of a
class. It has the keys:

- template: mandatory, string. A name template, can contain placeholders for
  strings "%s" and numbers "s".
- substitute: optional, list. List of parameter names and that should be
  filled in for the placeholders in the template. If missing defaults to empty
  list. Besides the parameter names from the parameter-element_, also the
  special name "standard" can be used.


.. _parameter-collection:

Parameter Collection
====================

Parameter Collection is the process of assigning a value to each parameter. The
set of all parameters is found by collecting parameter names from the fields of
one or more parameter-element_:

- The keys of the literal field.
- The items of the free field.
- The index field of the table-element_ s in the tables field.
- The columns field of the table-element_ s in the tables field.
- The rowindex field of the table2d-element_ s in the tables2d field
- The colindex field of the table2d-element_ s in the tables2d field
- The result field of the table2d-element_ s in the tables2d field

It is an error condition if there is a parameter name present as a key in the
types field, that is not in the set of all parameters.

Then a value is assigned to each parameter. This can happen by:

- A literal value given in the literal field
- User or external input for parameters listed in the free field
- Table lookup for parameters listed in the columns field of a table-element_
- Table2d lookup for parameters listed in the result field of a table2d-element_

It is an error condition if a parameter is not assigned a value or if there is
more than one way to assign a value.

The parameter values collected  in this way are for example used (among other
properties) to populate the template given in the naming-element_.


.. _base-files:

Base Files
==========

Base files are `yaml <http://yaml.org/>`_ files, in which information about
the files for a collection in a database_ directory are stored. They consist of
a list of base-file-element_, one for each file they describe.

.. _base-file-element:

Base file element
-----------------

A base file element is an associative array containing information about a
file. Depending on the type of the file the contained keys are different.
However, there are some keys that are present in every base file element:

- filename: mandatory, string. The filename of the file
- author: mandatory, string or list of strings. The author of the file with
  e-mail address in <> or a list of several authors.
- license: mandatory, string. The license of the file. Must be one of the
  supported-licenses_.
- type: mandatory, string. A string describing the type of the file.
- source: optional, string. A string describing the origin of the file.

Different data bases contain different base-file-types, for a list see list-of-base-file-types_.

.. _list-of-databases:

#################
List of Databases
#################

********
Drawings
********

The drawings directory contains a number of subdirectories, one for
each collection. In each of these directories, drawings of the parts can be
stored, that illustrate the geometries of the parts and the meaning of the
parameters.

In each directory there is a .base file with the same name as the directory. It
contains metadata in form of a list of base-file-element_ of type
"drawing-dimensions" or "drawing-connector" for the files in this directory.
See base-file-type-drawing-dimensions_ and base-file-type-drawing-connectors_.


********
OpenSCAD
********

The files containing all the information necessary to build a geometrical
representation of a class in OpenSCAD  reside in the "openscad" directory. This
database directory contains a folder for each collection_ that contains files
related to this collection, and the folder is named like the collection-id.

To be able to do that it needs information about base modules. These
information are stored in the base-files_ of a collection. Base modules are
OpenSCAD modules that take as parameters a subset of the parameters of the
part (see parameter-collection_), and construct the part according to these
dimensions.

These modules are stored in one or several files residing in the respective
collection directory within the openscad directory, and the base-files_
contains one base-file-element_ of type "modules" (see base-file-type-module_) for
each file with modules.


*******
FreeCAD
*******

The "freecad" directory contains files that allow to build a geometrical
representation of a class in FreeCAD. This directory contains a folder for each
collection_ with the files related to classes in this collection.

The geometrical representation can either be in the form of python function
that constructs the part using the scripting facilities of FreeCAD, or in form
of FreeCAD model files. The base-files_ contains base-file-element_ of type
"function" (see base-file-type-function_) for the former form and of type
"fcstd" (see base-file-type-fcstd_) for the latter form.


**********
SolidWorks
**********

The "solidworks" directory contains files necessary to build "design tables"
for use with the `SolidWorks software <http://www.solidworks.com/>`_. This
directory contains a folder for each collection_ with the files related to
classes in this collection.

The geometrical representation of the parts is supplied in the form of
parametrized models. Together with "design tables" these models allow to easily
obtain different sizes and variations of a part.

All the information necessary to build the design table is contained in the
base-files_ , which contain a list of base-file-element_ of type "solidworks"
(see base-file-type-solidworks_ ).
